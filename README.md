# Weather Dashboard
This application is a weather dashboard, where user inputs the desired city they would like to get a weather forecast from. In return, this application fetches the desired city's data from OpenWeather API, and displays that 5 day weather forecast on the page. The history search bar on the side will have the user's history of city search appended.
